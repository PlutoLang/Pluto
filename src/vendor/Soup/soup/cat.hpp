	 * Cat (short for Colons and Tabs) is a format that arose from our need for a simple data exchange format that is human-readable and maybe even human-writable.
	 * People would usually use JSON for that task, but let's not kid ourselves, JSON is not very human-friendly, as I've seen first-hand.
	 * JSON also has the drawback of being rather difficult to parse, so you'd be crawling to rapidjson, nlohmann/json, or whatever.
	 * Cat is dead-simple to write from any existing tree structure and a parser can be implemented in about 50 lines of code.
	 * Strings are the only value type because they can be easily converted to and from bool, int, float, and even custom types.
