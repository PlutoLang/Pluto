# Pluto
Pluto is a fork of the Lua 5.4 programming language. Lua is designed to be a small, fast, and embeddable language. It's used very often in games and resource-restricted regions. Lua bites a bullet by needing to stay small though, it lacks general-purpose features. This strain on the language makes it difficult to produce complex scripts at an accelerated rate. It takes more time to implement alternatives for missing syntax, or writing your own manual functions to split strings.

Pluto is a dialect of Lua which intends on removing these cons, which makes Pluto a best-of-both-worlds Lua dialect.
